# MiscellaneousStuff

## Welcome to the `MiscellaneousStuff` repository!
This repository contains a collection of random code snippets and small projects.

### For example:
```
greek_letterz=[chr(code) for code in range(945,970)]

for i in range(len(greek_letterz)):
    print(f"Letter : {greek_letterz[i]}, code : {ord(greek_letterz[i])}\n")
    # Prints all greek letters and their code.
```
